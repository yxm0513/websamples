User authentication is one of the things that we repeat every time we create a new project and once you have finished your [boilerplate](https://rafamed.dev/blog/how-to-create-a-django-rest-framework-boilerplate-project) is the next thing I use to set up if I need that functionality so with that said, we’ll see how you can create a custom user model including authentication endpoints with **JSON Web Tokens**.

## Installing JWT

First up, we are going to install **JWT** for **Django** to be able to generate our authentication token that we need to send POST HTTP requests that need a user logged in.

```bash
pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt
```

Once we do that, we can use this library a bit later.

## Settings configuration

Now we need to open our _settings.py_ file to add some configuration.

```python
# ...other imports
import timedelta

# ...settings code

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'users.UserProfile'

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
        )
}

SIMPLE_JWT = {
    'ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=1),
    'REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=30),
    'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS': False,
    'BLACKLIST_AFTER_ROTATION': True,
    'UPDATE_LAST_LOGIN': False,

    'ALGORITHM': 'HS256',

    'VERIFYING_KEY': None,
    'AUDIENCE': None,
    'ISSUER': None,

    'AUTH_HEADER_TYPES': ('Bearer',),
    'AUTH_HEADER_NAME': 'HTTP_AUTHORIZATION',
    'USER_ID_FIELD': 'id',
    'USER_ID_CLAIM': 'user_id',
    'USER_AUTHENTICATION_RULE': 'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.default_user_authentication_rule',

    'AUTH_TOKEN_CLASSES': ('rest_framework_simplejwt.tokens.AccessToken',),
    'TOKEN_TYPE_CLAIM': 'token_type',

    'JTI_CLAIM': 'jti',

    'SLIDING_TOKEN_REFRESH_EXP_CLAIM': 'refresh_exp',
    'SLIDING_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(minutes=5),
    'SLIDING_TOKEN_REFRESH_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=1),
}

# ...more code
```

## Create users app

Once we’ve finished with our JWT setup, we need to go ahead and create our user app for our project. We do that by opening our terminal and running the following command:

```bash
django-admin start app users
```

That will create a new directory in our project with the necessary files and ready to be registered.

## Register app

The next step is to add our newly created app. We open the _settings.py_ files and add the _users_ application inside the _INSTALLED_APPS_ array
—Register app code

## Create user model

Now we are ready to create our custom user model. The first thing to do is to open the _models.py_ file and import the base models from _django.contrib.auth.models_.

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin, BaseUserManager
```

Then we create our first model which will be the user manager capable of creating our superusers and the regular users and will have two methods the _create_user_ and _create_superuser_ both with “_self, email, username, password_’’ parameters.

```python
class UserProfileManager(BaseUserManager):
    """Manager for user profiles"""

    def create_user(self, email, username, password=None):
        if not email:
            raise ValueError('Users must have an email')

        email = self.normalize_email(email)
        user = self.model(email=email, username=username)

        user.set_password(password)
        user.save(using=self._db)

        return user

    def create_superuser(self, email, username, password):
        user = self.create_user(email, username, password)

        user.is_superuser = True
        user.is_staff = True
        user.save(using=self._db)
```

The _create_user_ method will create a new user in our database but first will validate if the email field is empty and will raise an error stating that the email is already registered, then we’ll set the _email, user, and password_ from the parameters, save them in our database and return the user at the end.

The _create_superuser_ is more straightforward due to we are reusing all of the logic from our _create_user_ and adding some extra properties like the _is_superuser_ and _is_staff_.

Now that we have our user manager model we can create our _userProfile_ model which will include all of the necessary fields for our user.

We need to create a class with _AbstractBaseUser_ and _PermissionsMixins_ models that we imported earlier as parameters. We proceed to create the following fields:

```python
class UserProfile(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=255, unique=True)
    username = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
    avatar = models.URLField(blank=True, null=True)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    is_staff = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    objects = UserProfileManager()

    USERNAME_FIELD = 'username'
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['email']

    def __str__(self):
        return self.email
```

As you can see we created an object variable that is referencing our _userProfileManager_ model in order to use this for our ORM queries in our views later. Also, we declare a constant named `USERNAME_FIELD` that is equal to "_username_" in order to be able to log in with our username instead of the email.

## Create serializers for user

Once we have our user model, we can create our serializer which is the way **Django Rest Framework** “translate” the **python** data into **JSON** data and vice versa by creating a file named _serializer.py_ inside of our user folder. Inside the file we are going to start by importing _serializers from rest_framework_ and also our _UserProfile_ model from _.models_

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import UserProfile
```

Then we need to create a class with the name of our model followed by the word **Serializer** for convention and passing _serializers.ModelSerializer_ as a parameter from _rest_framework_. Inside the class we need to create another class named _Meta_ which is going to include the model we are serializing and the fields we want to show in our **JSON** response and additionally include some _extra_kwargs_ where we are telling that the password field is “_write-only_”. Finally, we create a method that will create a new row in our database with the new user when we register a new one.

```python
class UserProfileSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = UserProfile
        fields = ('id', 'email', 'username', 'password', 'avatar')
        extra_kwargs = {'password': {'write_only': True}}

    def create(self, validated_data):
        user = UserProfile.objects.create_user(**validated_data)
        return user
```

## Create views

Now we are ready to create our views which are basically classes that run **HTTP** methods with the corresponding **ORM** queries and business logic inside when a URL has been called. We are going to start up by importing all the things we need

```python
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.parsers import JSONParser, MultiPartParser, FormParser
from .models import UserProfile
from .serializers import UserProfileSerializer
```

Then we can create our first view which is going to be called _RegisterUserView_ and we are going to pass _APIView_ that was imported earlier. This - as the name states - is going to be the view we want to use when the **/users/register** URL is called.

Inside our class, we are going to add our _parser_classes_ variable which is going to be equal to the parsers we imported as well. Then we create a post method with the self and request parameters. Inside our method, we first are going to validate if the email has been already registered by searching for it in our database and raise an error if so, then we are going to serialize our data from our request, save the serializer and return a response with the serialized data and the corresponding **HTTP status**

```python
class RegisterUserView(APIView):
    parser_classes = [JSONParser, MultiPartParser, FormParser]
    def post(self, request):

        # if email is already in use
        if UserProfile.objects.filter(email=request.data['email']).exists():
            return Response({'error': 'Email already registered'}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
        else:
            serializer = UserProfileSerializer(data=request.data)

        if serializer.is_valid():
            serializer.save()
            return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```

The second view we need is the _UserView_ with the same _APIView_ parameter which is going to return the authenticated user that makes the request excluding the password. Inside the class, we are going to add the _permission_classes_ variable that is going to be equal to a tuple with the "_IsAuthenticated_" permission from **Django Rest Framework** and the _parser_classes_.

The **GET** method is only going to serialize the user from the request also we are going to create a **PUT** method in order to be able to change our user avatar image. The code should look like this:

```python
class UserView(APIView):
    permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated,)
    parser_classes = [JSONParser, MultiPartParser, FormParser]

    def get(self, request):
        serializer = UserProfileSerializer(request.user, many=False)
        return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

    # update user profile image
    def put(self, request):
        user = UserProfile.objects.get(email=request.user.email)
        user.avatar = request.data['avatar']
        user.save()
        return Response({'message': 'Image updated'}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

```

Finally, our last view is going to be the _AllUsersView_ with the _APIView_ parameter as well as the _"IsAuthenticated"_ permission class which is going to return all of our users and return the serialized response.

```python
class AllUsersView(APIView):
    permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated,)

    def get(self, request):
        users = UserProfile.objects.all()
        serializer = UserProfileSerializer(users, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

— You may be wondering why we didn’t create a login view and that’s because we are going to take care of that with **JWT**.

## Create routes

Now we are going to create a _url.py_ file in order to create the endpoints for our **API**. First off, we are going to import the _path from django.urls_, all of our _views from .views_ and the views for creating our access token, and the refresh token from **JWT**.

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import RegisterUserView, LogoutUserView, UserView, AllUsersView
from rest_framework_simplejwt.views import (
    TokenObtainPairView,
    TokenRefreshView,
)
```

Finally, we are going to create our _urlpatterns_ variable with the list of paths including the URL and the class view we are going to use for them.

It should look like this.

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('', AllUsersView.as_view()),
    path('user/', UserView.as_view()),
    path('register/', RegisterUserView.as_view()),
    path('token/', TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name='token_obtain_pair'),
    path('token/refresh/', TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='token_refresh'),
]
```

## Trying with thunder client

We can give it a try to the endpoints using **Postman** or the **Thunder** client extension in **VSCode**

### Register

![register view](https://res.cloudinary.com/rafamed-dev/image/upload/v1661992121/register-thunder_fkzxwy.png)

### Login

![login view](https://res.cloudinary.com/rafamed-dev/image/upload/v1661992121/login-thunder_tdnasq.png)

### User

![user view](https://res.cloudinary.com/rafamed-dev/image/upload/v1661992121/single-user-thunder_pv8crr.png)

### All users

![all users view](https://res.cloudinary.com/rafamed-dev/image/upload/v1661992121/users-thunder_oetbxo.png)

Now you can use this custom user and the authentication endpoints in your next project that needs authentication and save a lot of time. I hope this was helpful and don’t miss the next post about **Django**.
