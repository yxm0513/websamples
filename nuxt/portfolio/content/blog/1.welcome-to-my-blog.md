Hi everyone, my name is Rafael Valenzuela, I’m a self-taught web developer and this is my blog about the things that I think are worth sharing about web development.

I’m currently working with Vue and Nuxt on the front end and the Django Rest Framework and Postgres for the backend. I’m doing this because sometimes I’ve found myself struggling to try to do something or fix a bug and the only way it works is mixing different things from different places (blog posts, youtube videos, etc) and I’d like to keep my version of this solutions and share them with anyone who can uses when needed and save some time.

I’d also like to share my thoughts about certain topics related to the tech field like trends or any other stuff.

That being said, I hope you can join my journey and read what I have to say in the next articles.
